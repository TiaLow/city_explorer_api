# Project: City Explorer API

**Author**: Tia Low
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This application will utilize a front-end where the user can come to the webpage and search for a city that they would like information on. The user would like to be able to search for any city and get the relevant city information.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
- User needs to build server
- Need to npm init to create package.json
- npm i
- User needs to install express, dotenv, cors via npm
- npm install -S 'thing'
- Scaffold server.js to connect, test in terminal using nodemon

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
- Using Express
- Using dotenv
- Using cors
